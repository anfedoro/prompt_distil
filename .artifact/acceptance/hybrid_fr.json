code related to task deletion and login functionality\n\n## Change Request\n### Required Changes\n- Rewrite the 
test for task deletion\n- Add logging for login events\n\n## Constraints\n### Unclear Requirements\nThe 
following items need clarification or careful handling:\n- Exact location or function where login logging should
be added\n- Specific logging details or format\n\n### General Constraints\n- Maintain existing public APIs 
unless explicitly requested\n- Follow existing code patterns and conventions\n- Ensure backward compatibility 
where possible\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n### Functional Requirements\n- The task deletion test is rewritten and
functions correctly\n- Login events are logged appropriately\n\n### Quality Requirements\n- Code should be 
well-tested\n- Documentation should be updated if needed\n- No regressions in existing functionality\n\n## 
Assumptions\nThe following assumptions were made during analysis:\n- The task deletion test is located in 
test_tasks.py related to `delete_task`\n- Login logging should be added in the login handling code, possibly in 
`login_handler` within test_auth.py or related module\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Performance optimizations not 
explicitly requested\n- Major architectural changes unless necessary\n- Changes to external dependencies\n- 
UI/UX modifications unless specified\n\n## Deliverables\n- Modified source code files\n- Updated or new tests as
appropriate\n- Documentation updates if needed\n- Clear commit messages explaining changes\n\n## Related (if 
any)\n- test_tasks.py \u2014 `delete_task` (confidence: 0.80)\n- test_auth.py \u2014 `login_handler`
