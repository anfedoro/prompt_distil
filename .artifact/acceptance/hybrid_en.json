Request\n### Required Changes\n- Enhance logging in the sign-in handler\n- Rewrite the test related to deleting 
`delete_task`\n\n## Constraints\n### Unclear Requirements\nThe following items need clarification or careful 
handling:\n- Specific improvements required for sign-in handler logs\n- Details of the test rewrite for deleting
`delete_task`\n\n### General Constraints\n- Maintain existing public APIs unless explicitly requested\n- Follow 
existing code patterns and conventions\n- Ensure backward compatibility where possible\n\n## Acceptance 
Criteria\n### Functional Requirements\n- Sign-in handler logs are improved\n- Test for deleting `delete_task` is
rewritten and passes\n\n### Quality Requirements\n- Code should be well-tested\n- Documentation should be 
updated if needed\n- No regressions in existing functionality\n\n## Assumptions\nThe following assumptions were 
made during analysis:\n- `login_handler` corresponds to the sign-in handler\n- The test to rewrite is the one 
that deletes `delete_task` in test_tasks.py\n\n## Out of Scope\n- Performance optimizations not explicitly 
requested\n- Major architectural changes unless necessary\n- Changes to external dependencies\n- UI/UX 
modifications unless specified\n\n## Deliverables\n- Modified source code files\n- Updated or new tests as 
appropriate\n- Documentation updates if needed\n- Clear commit messages explaining changes\n\n## Related (if 
any)\n- test_tasks.py \u2014 `delete_task` (confidence: 0.90)\n- test_auth.py \u2014 `login_handler`
